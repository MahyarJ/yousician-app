# Yousician App

> Technical Aspects - by Mahyar Yahya

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- The project is available on my [Github](https://github.com/MahyarJ/yousician-app).
- The project UI is also available on [Netlify](https://yousician-hero.netlify.app/).

## Available APIs

A fake api is available for this assignment. In case need more information: [json server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

To start it, you must go inside the ‍‍`/api` folder, install the dependencies via `npm i` and run:

`npm run start-api`

Now if you go to http://localhost:3004 you should see the default json server page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

As I believe most of the developers like me have their port `3000` unavailable,
I changed the default port to `4040`

Open [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) to view it in the browser.

If you started the fake api already, the app works perfectly then.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
Other scripts are same as `create-react-app` documentation.
